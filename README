== What is SDLcam? ==

SDLcam is a simple Video4Linux program, that was designed to view video streams coming from a Philips USB Webcam.

It uses SDL, and has a simple user interface. SDLcam can save snapshots in Jpeg, PNG or BMP formats. It also has a lot of video filters that can be combined and applied in real time to the video stream. See Features for more info.
